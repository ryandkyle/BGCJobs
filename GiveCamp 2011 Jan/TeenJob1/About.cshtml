  <div id="h4a">Guiding Philosophy </div>
  <p>YouthForce believes that all youth have great potential.&nbsp; The power of YouthForce rests in our ability to connect the critical players in the youth employment challenge &ndash; students, parents, high schools, youth programs and employers &ndash;to accomplish what none can do alone. </p>

  <p>By engaging schools, business and teens, YouthForce provides teens with: </p>
  <ul>
    <li class="style3">t<span class="style4">he coaching they need to develop a history of academic and extracurricular achievement, </span></li>
    <li class="style4">role models and mentors to build personal and professional networks, </li>
    <li class="style4">career education to explore interests and opportunities, </li>
    <li class="style4">income to support college and family finances, and </li>

    <li class="style4">relevant internships that motivate their talent and dreams without limits.&nbsp;</li>
  </ul>
  <p>For low income and minority teens whose opportunities are often limited   by factors such as poverty, lack of role models, or networks,   YouthForce&rsquo;s internships demonstrate that their   dreams are achievable, that adults care about them, and that <em>they</em> hold the power to succeed in any path they choose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
  <div id="h4a">Business Strategy</div>
  	<p>YouthForce is a social entrepreneurial staffing service providing businesses a high value, low cost solution to the routine office and clerical needs that accumulate during the day.  Our private-sector recruiting, screening and payroll services remove the performance and liability concerns associated with youth employment.  Our proven sequence of goal setting, coaching, leadership trainings and recruiting talent result in risk free, productive, inspiring and employable teens who can perform any routine office duty to allow staff to focus on their high productivity work.  For high achieving low income teens without social networks, these professional work experiences provide a way out of the service economy into career relevant jobs that offer experience and role models they need to achieve their greatest ambition and potential. </p>

  	<p>Teens       serve internships with some of the most innovative and successful       employers across a wide range of professional fields in the Seattle area,       including ZymoGenetics
